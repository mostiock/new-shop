# Wallet Payment Integration Documentation

## Overview

The wallet payment system allows users to top up a virtual wallet, check their balance, and use the funds to purchase products. This implementation includes persistent storage to maintain wallet state across page navigations and sessions.

## Key Features

1. **Wallet Management**
   - View wallet balance and transaction history
   - Top up wallet funds using various payment methods
   - Withdraw funds to bank accounts
   - Filter transactions by type (deposits, withdrawals, purchases)
   - Transaction status tracking (pending, completed, failed)

2. **Wallet Payment**
   - Pay for orders using wallet balance
   - Authentication checks before allowing wallet payments
   - Insufficient funds validation
   - Persistent wallet state across sessions using localStorage

3. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Wallet balance display in header for quick access
   - Quick top-up functionality
   - Wallet tab in user profile for detailed management
   - Clear visual feedback for payment status

## Implementation Details

### Components

1. **WalletBalanceDisplay.tsx**
   - Displays wallet balance in the header
   - Provides quick top-up functionality
   - Handles loading states and authentication checks

2. **Wallet.tsx**
   - Main wallet management component in user profile
   - Displays transaction history
   - Provides top-up and withdrawal functionality
   - Filters transactions by type

3. **CartSidebar.tsx**
   - "Pay with Wallet" button with authentication check
   - Redirects to checkout with wallet payment method

4. **Checkout Page**
   - Wallet payment method selection
   - Wallet balance display
   - Insufficient funds warning
   - Balance update on successful payment

5. **Order Confirmation Page**
   - Shows payment method (wallet/card)
   - Displays payment status

### State Management

The wallet state is managed using the following approach:

1. **LocalStorage Persistence**
   - Custom `useLocalStorage` hook synchronizes React state with localStorage
   - Wallet data is stored under a user-specific key (`wallet_{userId}`)
   - Supports cross-tab synchronization

2. **Transaction Management**
   - New transactions are added to the wallet's transaction array
   - Balance is updated based on transaction amounts
   - Transactions include metadata (type, status, reference, etc.)

## User Flow

1. **Wallet Top-Up**
   - User clicks on wallet balance in header
   - Selects amount to top-up
   - After processing, wallet balance increases and a new transaction is added
   - Changes are persisted to localStorage

2. **Purchase with Wallet**
   - User adds items to cart
   - Clicks "Pay with Wallet" in cart sidebar
   - If not signed in, receives authentication prompt
   - At checkout, wallet is selected as payment method
   - System checks if wallet has sufficient funds
   - Upon successful purchase:
     - Wallet balance is reduced
     - A purchase transaction is added
     - Cart is cleared
     - User is redirected to order confirmation page

## Technical Implementation

### Wallet Data Structure

```typescript
// WalletType interface
{
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  balance: number;
  currency: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  transactions: WalletTransactionType[];
}

// WalletTransactionType interface
{
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  amount: number;
  type: "deposit" | "withdrawal" | "purchase" | "refund";
  status: "pending" | "completed" | "failed";
  description: string;
  createdAt: string;
  reference?: string;
  orderId?: string;
}
```

### LocalStorage Hook

The custom `useLocalStorage` hook provides:
- Type-safe storage and retrieval
- Cross-tab synchronization
- Error handling
- Server-side rendering compatibility

### Authentication Integration

The wallet payment system integrates with Clerk authentication:
- User ID is used as part of the wallet storage key
- Authentication status is checked before wallet operations
- User profile information is displayed alongside wallet data

## Future Enhancements

1. **Backend Integration**
   - Replace localStorage with a real backend database
   - Implement proper payment processing
   - Add transaction verification

2. **Additional Features**
   - Scheduled top-ups
   - Payment limits and controls
   - Transaction export
   - Budget tracking and analytics

3. **Security Improvements**
   - Two-factor authentication for large transactions
   - Email notifications for wallet activity
   - Fraud detection systems

## Testing

When testing the wallet payment system:
1. Verify wallet balance updates correctly after top-up, withdrawal, and purchases
2. Check authentication requirements for wallet operations
3. Test insufficient funds scenarios
4. Verify persistence of wallet data across page navigation and browser refreshes
5. Validate transaction history filtering and display
