# Wallet Payment Integration

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive wallet payment system for the BOLES Smart Home e-commerce platform. This system allows users to top up their wallet, check their balance, and use their wallet funds to purchase products. The implementation includes persistent storage to maintain wallet state across page navigations and sessions.

## Key Features

1. **Wallet Management**
   - View wallet balance and transaction history
   - Top up wallet funds using various payment methods
   - Withdraw funds to bank accounts
   - Filter transactions by type (deposits, withdrawals, purchases)
   - Transaction status tracking (pending, completed, failed)

2. **Wallet Payment**
   - Pay for orders using wallet balance
   - Authentication checks before allowing wallet payments
   - Insufficient funds validation
   - Persistent wallet state across sessions using localStorage

3. **Order Confirmation**
   - Track orders paid with wallet
   - Display payment method information
   - Real-time order status updates

## Implementation Details

### Components Modified

1. **CartSidebar.tsx**
   - Added a "Pay with Wallet" button with authentication check
   - Added tooltip for unauthenticated users
   - Integrated with toast notifications for authentication errors

2. **Checkout Page**
   - Added wallet payment option in payment methods
   - Implemented form validation
   - Added wallet balance display and insufficient funds warning
   - Integrated with localStorage for persistent wallet data
   - Pass payment method to order confirmation page

3. **Order Confirmation Page**
   - Show correct payment method based on URL parameter
   - Updated order tracking timeline

4. **Profile Page**
   - Enhanced wallet component with persistent storage
   - Updated top-up and withdrawal functions to save changes to localStorage

### New Components/Hooks

1. **useLocalStorage Hook**
   - Custom hook for syncing React state with localStorage
   - Handles browser storage events for cross-tab synchronization
   - Type-safe implementation with TypeScript generics

## User Flow

1. **Wallet Top-Up**
   - User navigates to profile page and wallet tab
   - User selects "Top Up" and chooses an amount and payment method
   - After processing, wallet balance increases and a new transaction is added
   - Changes are persisted to localStorage

2. **Purchase with Wallet**
   - User adds items to cart
   - In cart sidebar, user clicks "Pay with Wallet"
   - If not signed in, user receives an authentication prompt
   - At checkout, wallet is automatically selected as payment method
   - System checks if wallet has sufficient funds
   - Upon successful purchase:
     - Wallet balance is reduced
     - A purchase transaction is added
     - Cart is cleared
     - User is redirected to order confirmation page

## Mock Data Implementation

For demonstration purposes, we've implemented mock data generation for:
- Wallet balance and transactions
- Order history with various statuses

In a production environment, these would be replaced with API calls to a backend service that handles actual payment processing and database storage.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Wallet Auto Top-Up**
   - Allow users to set up automatic top-ups when balance falls below a threshold

2. **Wallet Sharing**
   - Family wallet features to share balances between users

3. **Wallet Analytics**
   - Spending insights and budget tracking

4. **Payment Processing Integration**
   - Integration with real payment gateways for actual transactions

5. **Discount System**
   - Special discounts for wallet payments

## Testing Considerations

When testing the wallet payment system:
1. Verify wallet balance updates correctly after top-up, withdrawal, and purchases
2. Check authentication requirements for wallet operations
3. Test insufficient funds scenarios
4. Verify persistence of wallet data across page navigation and browser refreshes
5. Validate transaction history filtering and display
